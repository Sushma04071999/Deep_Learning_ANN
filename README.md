# About Dataset
My dataset related Banking sector. It consists of customer infoamtion with their credict score, age, balance ammount in their account, whether the customer is active or inactive. 
My entire data is stored in the csv file.

# Problem statment
The problem is customers are churning out form company day by day, do higher autorities identified the problem and decided to predict wheather the customer is going to exit the bank or not in the future.
I created the model which will check weather the customer is going to exit or not.
